# How to run

* Use Cl to open the folder OR VS2019 (I use CL on my computer)

* click the run project 

# Folder

* root: README.md which include program instruction.

* src: code file

* data: txt file

* cmake-build-debug: project1.exe

## Run Program Example

### Input

* type the file path: 

  * For windows: `..\data\project1.txt`
    
* Enter the mode:
  
  * `All`, `Expanded`, `Standard` (We can enter one of them)

* Enter the heuristic:
  
  * `StraightLine` or `Manhattan`

* Start x coordinate: 

  * E.g: 0 

  * Base on project1.txt, we can not input than 4 * 5

* Start y coordinate:

  * E.g: 2

  * Base on project1.txt, we can not input than 4 * 5

* End x coordinate:

  * E.g: 2

  * Base on project1.txt, we can not input than 4 * 5

* End y coordinate:

  * E.g: 3

  * Base on project1.txt, we can not input than 4 * 5

### Output

It took 0.0001017 seconds.

path:(0,1) (0,0) (1,0)

the output map is:

++d11

sXX11

11X11

# reflection

* I think my program can pass all the Grading case.

* I test all case in my computer, if that can auto grade test case, it should be work.
